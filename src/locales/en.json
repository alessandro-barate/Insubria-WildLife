The passion for animals, however, was born much earlier, when a wet nose woke me up in my crib, and never left me since; when I spent time in the garden with my grandmother learning names of flowers that I would later forget, because I was busy watching a lizard, a bee or chasing a passing bird. Today part of my job is trying to convey the wonder I feel at every little discovery...if I don't get lost in it!"

Deeply passionate and curious, as soon as I could, I traveled: for leisure and work, in Italy and abroad, taking part in volunteer projects. Every time I returned home, I found myself enriched with broader professional and personal experience. I've always loved learning and sharing with the people around me, and in my free time I travel, sleep in tents, read and draw (mostly feathered friends!)"

Since then, I have collaborated with many associations as a science communicator, guide in protected oases and wildlife parks, and for education in schools. Volunteering gave me the opportunity to come into contact with wildlife, and I still work in this field today. I am excited about my journey and the countless opportunities it has given me, but I am even more excited thinking about the support I will be able to give to Insubria Wildlife and everything that this new adventure will be able to give me!"

A raptor accidentally hit my grandparents' front door: I picked it up very carefully, went down to the garden, and when I slightly loosened my grip, it took flight in an instant. Something clicked in me that day: a feeling, a love for wildlife, that wasn't yet ready to fully bloom. It did during my university years, along with the certainty that it would never leave me again. Today I've made my passion my job. I love spending time outdoors, in the woods, in the company of my dogs or even just in silence with my camera, waiting for a kingfisher to perch on the branch in front of me."

Becoming a veterinarian was a dream that came true, but encountering wildlife took a large part of my heart. During my Erasmus project at a university clinic, I had a small otter as a patient, followed by raptors and bats: these experiences only strengthened my love for wildlife, culminating in an internship at a Wildlife Recovery Center, where I discovered the world of local fauna and the value of volunteering."
